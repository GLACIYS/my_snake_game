# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` module. Eat food, grow longer, and try not to collide with walls or yourself!

## 🚀 Features

  - Wall collision resets the game
  - Self-collision resets the game
- Clean and modular code using OOP principles

## 🛠️ Modules Used

  - `food.py` – generates food at random positions
  - `scoreboard.py` – displays and updates the score
